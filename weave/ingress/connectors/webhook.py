"""Generic inbound-webhook connector (P1) — the platform's first event source.

Accepts any JSON-object POST body. The delivery id (→ idempotency key) is
taken from the standard retry headers first, then common payload keys; when
neither exists the event backbone's content-hash fallback still collapses
identical re-deliveries. The source timestamp comes from the payload — a
webhook that doesn't stamp its deliveries gets stamped once at the ingress
edge (by the service), never deeper in.
