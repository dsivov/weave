"""Ingress connector base — the pluggable interface for event sources (P1).

Mirrors the ``webingest/connectors`` plugin pattern (named class + one-line
``description`` + a registry in ``__init__.py``), but points the other way:
webingest connectors *pull documents out of* a site platform, ingress
connectors *normalize deliveries into* :class:`RawRecord`s for the event
backbone. Push sources implement :meth:`receive` (the webhook route calls it);
poll sources override :meth:`poll` (the P5 scheduler drives it).
