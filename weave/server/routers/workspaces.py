"""Workspace API — onboarding + the role-scoped operating manifest (P3).

  POST /onboard              — tailor + install a workspace, return per-role manifests
  GET  /workspace/manifest   — one role's operating context (RBAC-filtered actions)

The manifest assembles a single, role-scoped view of a workspace's installed
config so an agent gets its operating context in one call: object types, the
**actions it may invoke** (filtered by the role's RBAC grants), guardrails
(rules), lifecycle state machines, live skills, and MCP tools. A live view —
re-fetch it when the config changes.

``/onboard`` is the wizard: it uses the NL authors (OntologyAuthor / RuleAuthor)
to draft a **tailored** ontology + rules from a plain-English description, saves
them, seeds Role nodes, and returns the manifests. Generic — core learns no
roles/object types; it reflects whatever the description produced. Both require
Weave mode. See ``AGENTIC_PROJECT_GRAPH.html`` § Onboarding & the playbook.

_INTERVIEW_PROMPT = """You are the onboarding interviewer for Weave — a \
decision-aware knowledge graph that gives a project shared memory and a methodology it \
enforces. You are talking to the human lead setting up the workspace `{ws}`.

Through a SHORT conversation (aim for 4–6 exchanges), gather just enough to set the \
project up:
- what the project is and its purpose;
- who works on it — a single agent, or a team (and the role names);
- the main object types and their lifecycle (e.g. Task: pending→completed; \
ChangeRequest: open→in progress→closed);
- what decisions matter / what should be flagged for review;
- ONE concrete first piece of work to seed as the first change request.

Guidance:
- Ask ONE focused question at a time. Be concise and friendly.
- Prefer a standard preset vocabulary (for software teams: Module, Task, ChangeRequest, \
ArchitectureDecisionRecord, Commit, Developer). Only introduce a bespoke type with a \
clear reason — genericity matters.
- {repo_hint}

When — and only when — you have enough, STOP asking questions. Write a one-sentence \
summary, then output a single fenced json block EXACTLY in this shape and nothing after it:

```json
{{
  "brief": "2-4 sentence project summary (the onboarding document)",

relationships, to author the ontology from",

**Workspace:** `{ws}`{role_line}

Weave is this project's **shared, decision-aware memory**. It already
knows (or can be told) your modules, commits, and architecture, and it records *why*
things were decided so a later session inherits the reasoning instead of rebuilding
or second-guessing it. This playbook is generated live from **your** workspace's
installed config — the object types, actions, and guardrails below are the real ones.

---

## 1 · Wire up MCP (one time)

Everything — querying, recording decisions, discovering what you can do, invoking
governed actions — is a single **MCP** tool surface. Write this to `.mcp.json` at your
repo root, then (re)connect your MCP client:

```json
{mcp_block}
```

(The same operations also exist as REST endpoints under `{server_url}` if you ever want to `curl` them.)

## 2 · Backfill existing work — *if this isn't an empty repo*

Starting from a fork, or a codebase already in progress? Import its reality so the graph
knows it from day one (modules, the git author, recent commits and the modules they
touched, README/docs, and with `--code` the source itself):

```bash
curl -s {server_url}/workspace/backfill-script | python - --repo . --workspace {ws} --code
```

Skip this step for a brand-new empty project. Re-running is safe (idempotent upserts).

## 3 · Your operating manifest

Machine-readable view: `GET {server_url}/workspace/manifest{q}`

**Object types you work with:**
{_bullets(object_types, "None installed yet — run POST /onboard to tailor an ontology.")}

**Actions you may invoke** (via the `invoke_action` MCP tool; discover live with `get_manifest`):

{actions_tbl}

**Guardrails — the methodology gate** (advisory unless a rule rejects):
{_bullets(guardrails, "No rules installed — decisions are recorded without gating.")}

**Lifecycle state machines** (illegal transitions are refused with `409`):
{lifecycle_md}

## 4 · The three habits (in order of importance)

1. **Query before you build.** Never assume something doesn't exist — ask Weave first.
   `query_auto("Is there already a module that does X? Why is it like this?")`.
   A recorded decision is query-able immediately: `query_auto("explain <adr-slug>")`
   returns it with full rationale (Weave blends the decision store into every answer).
2. **Record the why, not the keystroke.** When you make a choice worth remembering —
   a design decision, a tech pick, an API contract, a **rejected** option — capture the
   *why* via `record_decision(...)` or a typed action. Filter: *if you can't say who
   decided it and why, it's telemetry, not memory.*
3. **Use governed actions for standard moves.** Discover them with `get_manifest`, then
   `invoke_action(...)` — each call is validated, may be flagged by the gate, and is
   written to the graph as an audit record.

## 5 · Read the signals

- **`PASS`** — recorded, nothing to review.
- **`FLAG`** — *advice*, not a block (e.g. a reuse check saying "confirm nothing already
  covers this"). Run a `query_auto` to check, then proceed.
- **`409` illegal transition** — the lifecycle state machine refused an illegal jump.
- **`403`** — RBAC: your role may not invoke that action.

## 6 · Help us validate the methodology 🙏

This may be an early run for your team. Use Weave naturally, and **tell us when it gets in
your way** — a tool that errors or confuses, a query that *should* have found something
but didn't, a `FLAG`/`409` that felt wrong, a missing or awkwardly-named action, or this
playbook being unclear. Keep a short running `cg/FEEDBACK.md` — ten small annoyances beat
none. Friction is exactly the data we need.

Build well — and grumble freely.
