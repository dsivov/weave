"""The pre-emit rules gate (wiring step 5).

A thin, Weave-owned object that a decision passes through before it is written:
it projects the decision to ``params`` (:mod:`weave_core.governance.rules.projection`),
evaluates the workspace rule set (:class:`~weave_core.governance.rules.RulesEngine`), and
returns a :class:`GateDecision` (``PASS`` / ``FLAG`` / ``REJECT``) plus the audit
record.

The decision path (e.g. ``WeaveGraph.emit_decision_trace``) holds an optional
``rules_gate``; when present it calls :meth:`RulesGate.check` before persisting:

* ``REJECT`` → raise :class:`RuleViolation` (caller maps to HTTP 422; nothing written),
* ``FLAG``   → persist, annotated with ``needs_review`` + the audit record,
* ``PASS``   → persist unchanged.

Keeping this in ``weave_core/`` means the only thing the existing decision
path needs is a guarded call into here — the engine is a dependency it *calls
into*, not part of the ``weave_core`` library.
