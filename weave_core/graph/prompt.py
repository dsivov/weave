You are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.

---Instructions---
1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.
    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:
        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.
        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `{entity_types}`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.
        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.
    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.
        *   Format: `entity{tuple_delimiter}entity_name{tuple_delimiter}entity_type{tuple_delimiter}entity_description`

2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.
    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.
        *   **Example:** For "Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X," extract binary relationships such as "Alice collaborated with Project X," "Bob collaborated with Project X," and "Carol collaborated with Project X," or "Alice collaborated with Bob," based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.
    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:
        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.
        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.
        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `{tuple_delimiter}` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**
        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.
    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.
        *   Format: `relation{tuple_delimiter}source_entity{tuple_delimiter}target_entity{tuple_delimiter}relationship_keywords{tuple_delimiter}relationship_description`

3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**
    *   The `{tuple_delimiter}` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.
    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`
    *   **Correct Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo{tuple_delimiter}location{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`

4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**
    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.
    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.

5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**
    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.
    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.

6.  **Context & Objectivity:**
    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.
    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.

7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**
    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `{language}`.
    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.

8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `{completion_delimiter}` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. "If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us."

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Stock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.

Among the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.

Financial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.

You are an expert keyword extractor, specializing in analyzing user queries for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Your purpose is to identify both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query that will be used for effective document retrieval.

---Goal---
Given a user query, your task is to extract two distinct types of keywords:
1. **high_level_keywords**: for overarching concepts or themes, capturing user's core intent, the subject area, or the type of question being asked.
2. **low_level_keywords**: for specific entities or details, identifying the specific entities, proper nouns, technical jargon, product names, or concrete items.

---Instructions & Constraints---
1. **Output Format**: Your output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown code fences (like ```json), or any other text before or after the JSON. It will be parsed directly by a JSON parser.
2. **Source of Truth**: All keywords must be explicitly derived from the user query, with both high-level and low-level keyword categories are required to contain content.
3. **Concise & Meaningful**: Keywords should be concise words or meaningful phrases. Prioritize multi-word phrases when they represent a single concept. For example, from "latest financial report of Apple Inc.", you should extract "latest financial report" and "Apple Inc." rather than "latest", "financial", "report", and "Apple".
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: For queries that are too simple, vague, or nonsensical (e.g., "hello", "ok", "asdfghjkl"), you must return a JSON object with empty lists for both keyword types.

    *   **Do NOT extract** (these pollute the graph): pronouns or deictic references (`it`, `this`, `they`, `the system`, `our approach`); bare generic nouns with no specific referent (`the process`, `performance`, `best practices`); or opaque identifiers that are not meaningful entities on their own (raw commit hashes, log lines, environment-variable names, file paths) — unless the text gives them a clear, specific meaning.
    *   Prefer the entity's **canonical, fullest name** and use it consistently throughout.
    *   For each entity, extract:
        *   `entity_name`: Name of the entity (title-case if case-insensitive; consistent naming throughout).
        *   `entity_type`: One of `{entity_types}`, or `Other` if none apply.
        *   `entity_description`: Concise, objective, third-person description based *solely* on the text.
    *   **Output Format — Entities:** 4 fields delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, first field must be literal `entity`:
        *   `entity{tuple_delimiter}entity_name{tuple_delimiter}entity_type{tuple_delimiter}entity_description`

2.  **Relationship Extraction with Relation Context (rc):**
    *   Identify direct, clearly stated relationships between extracted entities.
    *   **Connect what you extract:** every entity you output should participate in at least one relationship where the text supports it — prefer relating an entity to another over leaving it unconnected. Do NOT invent relationships the text doesn't state, but do capture the ones it does (including implicit-but-clear links like membership, authorship, location, causation, or part-of).
    *   For each relationship, extract the standard fields PLUS a compact JSON **Relation Context** as the 6th field.
    *   **Standard fields (1–5):**
        *   `source_entity`: Name of source entity (consistent with entity extraction).
        *   `target_entity`: Name of target entity (consistent with entity extraction).
        *   `relationship_keywords`: Comma-separated high-level keywords (no `{tuple_delimiter}` inside this field).
        *   `relationship_description`: Concise explanation of the relationship.
    *   **6th field — Relation Context JSON:**
        *   A **single-line, compact JSON object** (no newlines or pretty-printing) with these keys:
            *   `"supporting_sentences"`: Array of up to 3 direct verbatim quotes from the text that support this relationship. Use `[]` if none.
            *   `"temporal_info"`: Validity period or timestamp (e.g., `"Q4 2026"`, `"since 2020"`), or `null`.
            *   `"quantitative_data"`: Numerical data (amounts, percentages, counts), or `null`.
            *   `"decision_trace"`: The rationale, exception, or approval behind this relationship (the "why"), or `null`.
            *   `"approved_by"`: Name of the person or team who approved this decision (e.g., `"VP_Smith"`, `"Finance_Team"`), or `null` if not mentioned.
            *   `"approved_via"`: Channel through which approval was given — one of `"slack"`, `"zoom"`, `"email"`, `"in_person"`, `"jira"`, `"system"` — or `null` if not mentioned.
            *   `"valid_from"`: ISO-8601 date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) when this decision became effective, or `null` if not stated.
            *   `"valid_until"`: ISO-8601 date (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`) when this decision expires, or `null` if not stated.
            *   `"policy_ref"`: Name or ID of the policy this decision follows or overrides (e.g., `"DiscountPolicy_Standard"`), or `null` if not mentioned.
            *   `"provenance"`: Source reference (speaker name, document section, timestamp), or `null`.
            *   `"confidence_score"`: Float 0.0–1.0 indicating extraction confidence based on text clarity.
        *   Fill `approved_by`/`approved_via` when the text mentions who approved something and how. Fill `valid_from`/`valid_until` when explicit dates are given. Fill `policy_ref` when a policy name or ID is referenced.
        *   The JSON must NOT contain `{tuple_delimiter}` characters.
    *   **Output Format — Relationships:** 6 fields delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, first field must be literal `relation`:
        *   `relation{tuple_delimiter}source_entity{tuple_delimiter}target_entity{tuple_delimiter}relationship_keywords{tuple_delimiter}relationship_description{tuple_delimiter}RELATION_CONTEXT_JSON`

3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**
    *   `{tuple_delimiter}` is an atomic field separator — never use it *inside* a field value.
    *   The RELATION_CONTEXT_JSON field must be a single JSON object on the same line.

4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**
    *   Treat all relationships as undirected unless stated otherwise.
    *   Avoid duplicate relationships.

5.  **Output Order:** All entities first, then all relationships (most significant first).

6.  **Context & Objectivity:** Third-person perspective; no pronouns; explicit entity names.

7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:** Output in `{language}`; keep proper nouns in original language.

8.  **Completion Signal:** Output `{completion_delimiter}` after all extraction is complete.

Sales Conversation Pattern: Lost Deal
Company: TechGadgets

Value Range: 1,000-2,000
Products Discussed: Premium Wireless Speaker
Conversation Length: 14 messages

## Conversation Transcript

**Customer:** Hi, I'm interested in the Premium Wireless Speaker. What's the best price you can offer?

**Sales Agent:** The Premium Wireless Speaker is listed at $1,499. It's our top-rated product with excellent reviews.

**Customer:** That's quite expensive. I saw the SoundMax Pro from AudioRival for $999 with similar features.

**Sales Agent:** Our product has superior build quality and longer warranty coverage.

**Customer:** I understand, but the price difference is significant. Can you match their price or offer a discount?

**Sales Agent:** Unfortunately, we can't match competitor pricing. Our standard policy doesn't allow discounts beyond 5%.

**Customer:** That's not enough. I'll go with AudioRival then. Thanks anyway.

entity{tuple_delimiter}Premium Wireless Speaker{tuple_delimiter}artifact{tuple_delimiter}Premium Wireless Speaker is a top-rated product by TechGadgets listed at $1,499, discussed in a lost sales conversation.
entity{tuple_delimiter}AudioRival{tuple_delimiter}competitor{tuple_delimiter}AudioRival is a competitor offering the SoundMax Pro at $999, cited by the customer as an alternative to the Premium Wireless Speaker.

entity{tuple_delimiter}Price Too High{tuple_delimiter}lossreason{tuple_delimiter}The customer found the $1,499 price too high compared to the competitor's $999 offering, a $500 price gap that could not be bridged by the 5% maximum discount policy.
entity{tuple_delimiter}Competitor Pricing Objection{tuple_delimiter}objection{tuple_delimiter}The customer objected to the price by citing a competitor (AudioRival SoundMax Pro at $999) offering similar features at a lower price.

Rules:
- Include a relationship ONLY if both of its entities appear in "entities".
- ALWAYS include "relation_context" for every relationship, populated with at least "supporting_sentences" (a verbatim quote from the text) and "confidence_score" in [0,1]. Omit only the individual sub-fields the text does not support — never omit the whole "relation_context".
- Fill in EACH sub-field whenever its trigger is present in the text — do not settle for supporting_sentences + confidence_score when more is available. Triggers:
  * "quantitative_data": ANY number, amount, percentage, count, price, or measurement tied to the relationship (e.g. "21 theme nodes", "20% discount", "$1,499").
  * "decision_trace": ANY stated reason, rationale, justification, cause, purpose, hypothesis, or "why" behind the relationship — even a one-clause explanation.
  * "provenance": the source of the claim (document, section, channel, meeting, or example it comes from) whenever it is identifiable — fill this on nearly every relationship.
  * "temporal_info": any validity period, date range, or "as of" phrasing.
  * "approved_by" / "approved_via" / "policy_ref" / "valid_from" / "valid_until": explicit approvals, decision channels, policies, or validity dates.
  Aim to populate 3+ sub-fields per relationship when the text allows; a bare supporting_sentences + confidence_score is only acceptable when the text truly offers nothing more.
- Do NOT invent facts. Every value must be grounded in the input text.
- Exclude non-entities: file paths, code identifiers, environment-variable names, git hashes, bare numbers, and pronouns.
- Treat relationships as undirected unless the text states a direction.
- Return ONLY the JSON object.

Examples follow. Study how every relationship carries a relation_context — decision-rich relations fill the approval/policy fields; ordinary factual relations still carry supporting_sentences and confidence_score.
