"""Graph communities & thematic "global" retrieval (Graph-Quality v-next, Topic 3, Layer 4).

Real community detection (Louvain, via networkx) partitions the entity graph into
themes; the LLM summarises each; a query retrieves the relevant community summaries
and synthesises a holistic answer — a genuine GraphRAG-style "global" mode, unlike
the current vector-search-over-edges "global".
