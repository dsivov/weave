"""Layer A — deterministic canonicalization for entity deduplication.

Turns a raw (already sanitized) entity name into a canonical **key** used to match
duplicates, and helps pick a canonical **display name** for a merged cluster. Pure
and deterministic — the cheap, auditable first line of dedup. The raw name is always
preserved by the caller; this only derives the matching key.

What the key collapses: case, diacritics (``Málaga`` → ``malaga``), surrounding/─inner
punctuation, acronym dots (``I.B.M.`` → ``ibm``), and trailing legal/org suffixes
(``Acme Inc.`` → ``acme``).
What it deliberately does **not** do: acronym↔expansion (``IBM`` vs ``International
Business Machines``) or synonyms — those need embeddings (Layer B) or the LLM
(Layer C). Singular/plural folding is intentionally omitted (too aggressive for a
conservative policy).
