"""FlowTrigger — the bus subscriber that starts flows from events (P2).

Mirrors :class:`~weave.ingress.service.DecisionSubscriber`: it sits
on the ingress bus and, for each event, starts every flow in that workspace
subscribed to the event's type. :meth:`FlowExecutor.start` is idempotent on the
run id, so a re-delivered event never double-starts a run.

Flow orchestration is deliberately *isolated* from the ingress response: a flow
that halts (a gate REJECT on one of its task actions, a bad definition) is
logged, not raised, so it never turns a successful delivery into an error. The
primary decision quad is the DecisionSubscriber's concern; the flow is the
conductor layered on top.
