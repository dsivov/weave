"""Artifact diff — the one authoring gesture (P0).

Authoring, migration, and re-approval all produce an :class:`ArtifactDiff` and
run it through the same ``DiffEngine`` (decisions 4/5/7); only ``origin`` differs.
``behaviour_changed`` (set by ``DiffEngine.assess`` via dry-run / test_cases)
decides whether full sign-off is required or a lightweight approval suffices. See
docs/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.html.

#: The artifact kinds the signed ledger versions.
#:
#: `rbac` and `lifecycle` joined in P4 (R35), and the reason is A8: what the
#: runtime enforces is the signed ledger version, and roles, RBAC and lifecycle
#: have **no server-file config path**. A wizard that wrote a config file the
#: runtime does not read would be a second source of truth; making them ledger
#: kinds is what lets the wizard change governance the only way anything else
#: does — a diff, a signature, a version, and history to roll back to.
DIFF_KINDS = (
    "ontology", "rule", "flow", "action", "diagram", "app", "rbac", "lifecycle",

#: Why a version exists. `removal` is **structural, not cosmetic** (M5 review).
#:
#: A removal records an empty snapshot — and an empty snapshot is ambiguous in a
#: way that inverts behaviour: an *authored* empty RBAC policy exists and grants
#: nothing (deny-by-default), while a *removed* one leaves no policy, which this
#: system treats as permissive. Without a marker, anything replaying that version
#: gets the opposite of what was recorded, and the only thing distinguishing the
#: two is a free-text reason.
